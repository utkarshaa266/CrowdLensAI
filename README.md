# CrowdLensAI
This project uses AI to monitor public crowds and detect unsafe situations in real time. It automatically identifies suspicious behavior and sends instant alerts to authorities and trusted contacts, improving safety without manual intervention.
Problem
In urban areas, people—especially women—often face unsafe routes due to low crowd presence or sudden overcrowding. Existing navigation apps show routes, but they don’t tell us whether a route is safe right now.
Solution – CrowdLens AI
CrowdLens AI is a real-time crowd intelligence and women safety platform that predicts crowd density and identifies safe or unsafe routes using location-based insights.
Our system visualizes live crowd density on a map, estimates safety levels, and provides an SOS emergency system for immediate help.
How It Works
Users securely log in to the platform, select an area, and view real-time crowd density and safety status.
If a route is unsafe, the system highlights safer, more crowded alternatives.
In emergencies, users can trigger an SOS alert with one click.
Google Technologies Used
We use Google Firebase Authentication for secure user login and Google Firestore to store real-time SOS alerts and safety data in the cloud.
This enables fast, scalable, and real-time updates—perfect for emergency response systems.
Impact
CrowdLens AI can help:
Women choose safer routes
Authorities monitor crowd conditions
Cities respond faster to emergencies
Future Scope
We plan to integrate Google Maps Platform for live routing and Google Cloud Vision API to automatically estimate crowd density and gender ratio from camera feeds.
CrowdLens AI transforms crowd data into actionable safety intelligence, making cities smarter and people safer.
